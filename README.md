# Covid_CrossCheck_Mask_OnFace

Project to use deep learning to determine if the person is wearing a mask or not.
System is trained with high number of images and tested with unseen data set. 

Note: Sample datais very limited due to space constraint with github accounts. I will try to add more files based on requests.
